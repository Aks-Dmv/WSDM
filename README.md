# WSDM

![alt text](Figure_1.png)

This repository was created in partial fulfillment for the research based course Study Oriented Project (SOP), which I took at BITS. 

This repository contains code that a DDPG agent to first conform to a given clustering strategy using behavioral cloning, and then iteratively adapt to new influxes in data points.

We use TensorFlow and Keras to create our models and ipython notebooks to run our code.

## Software Setup

The following Python libraries are required for running the repository:

1. Tensorflow (1.0)
2. Keras
3. Matplotlib
4. SKLearn
5. OpenAI Gym

We have included snapshots of different algorithms and the code can be run by starting up the 'DDPG.ipynb' in any of the folders and running it.
